# Apache-Spark--learning
A comprehensive collection of my learning journey with Apache Spark, covering core concepts, hands-on examples. This repository includes code snippets, tutorials, and practical implementations using Python for distributed data processing, transformations, and machine learning workflows.

For the movies related scripts , refer the dataset from this site - https://files.grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/ml-100k.zip 

The above scripts will give you the idea of spark and the concepts like lazy Evaluation and Actions by which Apache Spark give the outputs. 
Also for the other scripts all the csv files and text files are given in this repositry.

By doing these examples , you will be able to learn PySpark and Spark.
