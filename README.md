# Apache-Spark--learning
A comprehensive collection of my learning journey with Apache Spark, covering core concepts, hands-on examples. This repository includes code snippets, tutorials, and practical implementations using both Scala and Python for distributed data processing, transformations, and machine learning workflows.

For the movies related scripts , refer the dataset from this site - https://files.grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/ml-100k.zip 

The above scripts will give you the idea of spark and the concepts like lazy Evaluation and Actions by which Apache Spark give the outputs.
